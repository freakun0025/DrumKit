# Drum Kit Web Application

This is a simple Drum Kit web application that allows users to play drum sounds by either clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. Each button and key is associated with a different drum sound and changes color when pressed.

## Features

## How It Works

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a brief overview of the key parts of the application:

### HTML

- Contains buttons with class names corresponding to different drum sounds.
- Each button has a unique letter that matches a key on the keyboard.

### CSS

- Styles the buttons and other elements of the page.
- Buttons are styled to change color when pressed.

### JavaScript

- Handles button clicks and key presses.
- Plays corresponding drum sounds based on the button clicked or key pressed.
- Changes the color of the buttons when they are pressed.
